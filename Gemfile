# Run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!


# Use GitHub Pages gem to match GitHub build environment
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# Add any custom plugins here (none needed for standard features)



# Visit https://pages.github.com/versions/ to see the gems included
# in the GitHub Pages gem. If you include gem 'github-pages' in your
# Jekyll projectâ€™s Gemfile and run bundle install, Bundler will
# automatically fetch and install the github-pages gem along with all
# its runtime dependencies (e.g., jekyll, jekyll-feed, jekyll-seo-tag, etc.).
# This ensures your local environment matches the GitHub Pages environment.

# If you're developing on Windows, you may need to install additional gems.
# like tzinfo, tzinfo-data, and wdm.

# If you're using a custom domain, you'll need to add a CNAME file to your
# site's root directory with your domain name. You can also add a TXT file
# to verify your domain with GitHub Pages.
