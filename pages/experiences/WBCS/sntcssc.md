During my stint as Officer-in-Charge SNTCSSC, Darjeeling:  

There are 2 Study Centres of SNTCSSC in the district of Darjeeling- one at Darjeeling Government College, Darjeeling. Another at North Bengal University, Siliguri.  
On 22nd September, 2023, a mega Civil Services Workshop was organised at Dinabandhu Mancha, Siliguri, graced by senior dignitaries. Students from major colleges of 6 districts in North Bengal attended and were motivated to appear for Civil Services Examination.  
In November and December 2023, several awareness workshops were organised where senior officers from Civil, Police and Forest Services motivated and guided students for the UPSC Civil Services Examination and to apply for SNTCSSC coaching.  
Selection tests for the 2023-24 batch of SNTCSSC were successfully held whereby 50 students in Darjeeling centre and 38 students in Siliguri centre were selected.  
Daily online classes by Khan Study Group, Delhi are organised in the Smart Classrooms of both centres.
Weekly physical and daily online sessions and mock tests by various officials were organised at the centre on different subjects for the Civil Services Exam. This has made the Darjeeling Centre one of the most active in the state. The same was appreciated by senior faculty from KSG also.
