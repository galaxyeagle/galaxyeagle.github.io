<h4> Docketing & Despatch </h4>

- Daks are received in general section from where they're distributed to different sections
- Daks relating to service matters like Leave, Joining, etc are sent to Estt. section
- On receipt, the Dak document is given a Docket no. & noted in 'Receiving Register'. This is called Docketing.
- I also learnt about the types of Memos, Orders, Circulars & Reminders issued from Estt. section.
- Memos whose replies go to other offices (eg. SDO office, etc.) are entered in 'Issue Register'
-
