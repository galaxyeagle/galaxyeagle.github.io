### Trade in which animal articles/trophies are allowed under this Act? ###

Firstly, Chap VA ins. vide 1991 amdt. contains 2 imp. sections : 49A & 49B. 
Sec 49 A defines Animals included in Schedule I or Part II of Schedule II as “ Scheduled animals”. Also it says that any article in which the whole or part of any Scheduled animal is used, is a “Scheduled animal article”, excluding tail feathers of peacock and snake venom.

Now Sec 44 says that trade in any animal article is allowed after taking a licence from CWW. But Sec 49B is an exception to Sec 44.
Sec 49B says that trade in (i) a "Scheduled animal article" & (ii) foreign ivory imported into India, is banned & even a Sec 44 licence can't legalize it !
