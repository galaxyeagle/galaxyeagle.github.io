<button onclick="expand('1987')"> 2. "Introduction to Indian Government Accounts and Audit" issued u/a/o CAG" (1987 Ed.)   </button>

<div id="1987" style="display:none">


<h4> Budget </h4>
Receipts...Annual Finance Bill/Act <br>
Expdt... Annual Financial Statements (its 'made' expenses are voted as DfG)...then Appropriation Bill/Act <br>



<h4> Charged & Voted Expdt. : </h4>
U/As 112 & 203 Const.,
Charged exp => discussed but not voted.
Voted exp=> presented as DfG & voted. 'c' or 'v' in Major head signifies this.<br>

<h4> Revenue & Capital Expenditure </h4>

- General principles for allocation of expenditure between Revenue & Capital heads :<br><br>
Capex permanent assets or reduces recurring liabilities...grant-in-aid is revex...capex-cap receipts & revex-rev receipts linkage should be maintained in budget afap...Give egs.
  Also ref. Memo 581-FB wherein govt. declared certain revex associated with cap. schemes as capex : site prep, proff fees, initial costs, installation, intermediate maint. costs
  
  <h4>Main principles governing allocation of expenditure on a capital scheme between capital and revenue accounts</h4>

As per GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING RULES, 1990 : <br>
(a)     Capital account should bear all charges for the first construction and equipment <br>
(b)     revenue account should bear all subsequent charges for maintenance <br>

(c)    Renewals/replacement goes from rev a/c whilst Genuine improvements go from cap a/c.<br>
(d)     Expenditure on account of reparation of damage caused by extraordinary calamities such as flood, fire, earthquake, enemy action, should be charged to Capital account or to Revenue account or divided between them in such a way as may be determined by Government according to the circumstance of each case.<br>

(e)     Capital receipts in a project (eg world bank loan) should go for capex, uless a govt GO.<br>

<h4> Structure of govt. accounts </h4>

Consolidated Fund (Art 266(1)) ... has 3 divs - Revenue, Capital & Debt<br>
Public Account (Art 266(2)) .. where govt. acts as a banker . Includes 6 A/Cs â€“ Provident fund & Small savings, Deposit and advances, Cash Remittance, Suspense, Reserve fund, Cash balance <br>
Contingency Fund (Art 267)...to meet unforseen expdt pending approval of parliam/legislature<br><br>
Suspense heads accommodate temporarily, transactions which can not be taken in to final heads. It contains transactions which are ultimately removed either by recovery in cash/payt/book adjustment. Also all interstate transactions take place through suspense accounts. Suspense a/c is a part of public a/c. <br>

NB. Vide 1881-FB dt. 2018, GoWB did away with Plan/Non-plan expdt.<br>

<h4> Head of Accounts </h4>

art 150..cag advices presi to release form of account-keeping for union and states...Accordingly,Codification done not based on dept of expdt/receipt, but on the basis of function/programme,etc (mukherjee commission reco)....In both expdt & receipt HoA, the imp. heads are **Major**, Sub-major, **Minor**, Sub-head/Scheme head, **Detailed head**.<br>

<img src="/images/HoA.png" width="80%">   <!--- Don't set height AND width. Use one or the other and the correct aspect ratio will be maintained --->

<h4> Tax and non-tax revenue </h4>

<img src="/images/tax-nontax.jpg" width="80%">

<h4> Principles of classification of financial transactions of the government </h4>
Write about structure of govt accounts, HoAs, rev and cap heads, etc <br> 
Also eg. is 0049- interest receipts, 2059- public works <br> <br>

<h4> State borrowings and Ways & Means Advances </h4>

3 types of state borrowings : from mkt (OMOs), from institutions (eg nabard, wb), from RBI (WMA, overdraft, sdl, etc) <br> <br>

In terms of Article 292 & 293 of the Constitution of India, the union & state resp. can raise money by borrowing,
upon the security of the resp. Consolidated Fund.<br> <br>

WMA is short-term loan given by RBI to GoI/GoState @ Repo rate to meet short-term diff bw receipts & expdt.... (beneficial for govt since mkt borrowing (through selling g-secs/bonds in Open mkt) is usually 2-3 % above repo & limited to 3% of gsdp) <br>
Also every Tuesday RBI does SDL (special dev loans) auctions for state govt @ high interest rates & on fridays for GoI <br> <br>
Special WMA/Special Drawing facility (upto ~300 cr)... then Normal WMA (~ 3000 cr limit in covid era)... then overdraft @ repo+5%...if 14 days overdraft, then freezing of state govt banking transactions <br>
WMA is usually used when state govt treasury balance of consol fund goes to -ve...rbi publishes this balance for all states every morning.<br>


<h4> Financial committees </h4>

As per Art 118 for Parliam. & art 208 of Const. for state leg., every house can make its own 'RoP(Rules of Procedure)'. Under these rules various Standing & ad-hoc committes were made. 3 imp. standing committees are Estimates comm, PAC & Comm on pub. u/ts.
PAC - CAG audits govt's appropriation A/Cs. And PAC scrutinizes CAG's report. So re-does CAG's work ! Essentially, it checks whether funds alloted/reappr. by concerned House are utilized by Executive under proper heads. Thus its a post-mortem analysis & a legislative check on the Executive.
Estimates Comm - It suggests improvements (esp.economizing ones) in 'estimates of expdt.' ie. in Appr.Act/Budget after its voted in the house (&#8756; post-mortem).
Comm on public U/Ts - does work of both PAC & Est.comm. but for selected public undertakings every year.

<h4> Audits </h4>

General principles of govt. audit : <br>
1. Verifying the competetncy of sanctioning authority <br>
2.  to understand the system of account followed <br>
3. to check as far as possible the accuracy of the original record, namely, the cash book.<br>
4.  to see that all transactions are in accordance with the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors or the orders of competent authorities.<br>
5.  to investigate unusual items.<br>
6.  to check the compilation of the accounts from the original record and to suggest corrections in the classification of transactions.<br>
7.  to review the procedure of stock taking and of pricing the goods in hand.<br>
8.  to check the financial results, that is the Manufacturing, Trading and Profit and Loss Accounts, and the Balance Sheet, which will indicate accurately the progressive position of affairs. This necessitates also the investigation of depreciation of property (building, machinery, furniture etc.) the soundless of investments, debts due to the firm and the correct allocation of expenditure to Capital Account.<br>
9. Also to check allotment, sanction, fin propriety, etc<br>

<br><br>

Audit process.... Auditing..Audit queries on the spot...Audit replies on the spot...Else Audit paras sent later in IR (Inspection Report)...Broadsheet replies to those paras..Else unreplied paras become CAG paras (after passing through Draft Para stage) & presented to Parliam. <br><br>

CAG Audit... it has 3 parts - (a) Regularity Audit, (b) Propriety Audit and (c) Efficiency cum-Performance Audit. <br>

Audit of Public Debt ... An important duty of Audit in relation to borrowings is to see that the proceeds of loans are properly brought to account and that they are expended only on objects for which the loans were originally raised<br><br>
Audit of Receipts... incl. auditing receipts of customs, forest,etc. depts...whether receipts are regular & correct assessed amt & collection system is strong <br><br>
Audit of Expenditure .... nb. Three principal processes involved in payment of money on Govt accounts (apart from allotment & sanction order) are <br>
1.Submission of claim <br>
2.Disbursement of the money claimed<br>
3.Incorporation of the transactions in accounts <br><br>
Audit of sanction is where auditors SCRUTINIZE the SANCTION ORDER & every details therein (including whether the sanction was propoer as per dfpr devolved powers of Presi u/a 77(3) or Governor u/a 166(3)) (also incl timeline of sanction, whether even one item in the work is not without appr sanction, etc). <br><br>
Audit of Appropriation... = Sanction audit + Expdt audit. Audit of appr is done annually by CAG for each state and involves checking if excess expdt in a grant has been regularized through suppl appr act in state leg.(as per art 205 of const.), and also if deficient expdt under a grant/dept (ie savings) has been surrendered by that dept to finance dept by 14th feb or not (as per WBBM). Also proper HoAs maintained or not, and other points of expdt audit


<br><br>
Audit of Contingent expenditure... gen. expdt. points + for specific cont. expdt. types + UC + ePradan will show if money imm. rxed by vendor <br><br>

Central Audit ... confined to the offices of the AG (Audit) located in the different States..done by central audit party..they check the diff schedules,vouchers,etc sent to ag office by diff treasuries & also various sanction orders & processes  followed in ag office. It is largely a regularity and propriety audit. <br>
Local audit (of treasuries by AG) may be distinguished from inspection in that its purpose is to audit the initial accounts maintained in certain Government offices on the spot. Here the duties of audit are not confined merely to seeing whether the initial accounts are maintained in proper form or whether the financial rules are properly observed but a test audit of accounts is conducted in sufficient detail to verify the accuracy and completeness of accounts according to the prescribed rules.



<h4>Transactions with other govts</h4>
AG of State 1... Central Accounts Section of the Reserve Bank, Nagpur (Suspense head) .... AG of State 2 or Centre <br>
Egs. Loan by centre to state, repayt of loan+interest by state to centre, etc  <br><br>

| 1-3 yrs | HoO |  <br>
| 3-6 yrs | HoD of current dept |  <br>

<h4> Chap.8 : Responsibility for withdrawl from govt. accounts  </h4>

Rule 8.09 : A bill has 2 fates: either stamped "paid" on it (ie. it becomes a voucher ie. a proof of payt.), or Cancel it (To prevent its re-use). NB. Bill contains account of works done/goods supplied..whilst many sub-vouchers may be part of a bill..sub-vouchers are given by vendor directly &  <br>
Rule 8.11 : All sub-vouchers(~quotations by vendors) must be cancelled <br>

<br>

Functions entrusted with the Treasury ... It rxes money due to govt offices & pays claims made to govt.(via DDO). Also : presents A/Cs to AG, banker of panchayat funds, strong room. <br><br>
Checks to be applied in the Treasury in case of payment... Bill in proper TR form, DDO sign present, proper math, allotment, sanction, Head of account, no erasures, subvouchers needed for bills>Rs 500/- , Schedule of recoveries (eg tds, p tx) are properly deducted & by-transfered into correct HoA <br><br>
<b>Monthly accounts to be submitted by TO to AG (& onward compilation/consolidation)... </b> Ref TR 2.35 ...1st schedule of payts.(only expdt. no receipts)(by 12th day) & Secondary List of payts, Cash account( ie receipts) & Supporting schedule with challans/vouchers (by 5th working day) sent by TO to AG (alongwith all vouchers(ie paid bills) & subvouchers..so treasury becomes empty of papers:))....Then its compiled for all tresuries by AG...AG sends to CGA,India & FinDept,GoWB...then compiled for all states by CGA...Then CGA sends it to the Budget division of MoF,GoI & also to RBI, Nagpur (for reconciliation) <br><br>
Relation bw audit & finance depts of govt. Both have same objectives ie Eff & propriety of govt finance AND safeguarding public money<br>
FinDept makes rules/Forms (Pre-mortem) & Audit checks whether those rules/forms are followed (Post-Mortem). AG sends a copy of its report to FinDept(Audit section). FinDept consults AG before making rules/budget...so a cyclical relationship.
