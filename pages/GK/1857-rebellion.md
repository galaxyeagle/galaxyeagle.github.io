- The British portayed the rebellion as per their suitability.'The Relief of Lucknow' was a famous painting by Barker in 1859 which signified the reclamation of Lucknow by Outram/Havelock(1st relief) and Campbell(2nd relief) after Lawrence was killed during the Siege of Lucknow.
- The painting 'In Memorium' by Paton (1859) shows helplessness of innocent British women during the war.
- During the Siege of Cawnpore, besieged EEIC forces surrendered to Nana Sahib for a safe passage to Allahabad, but British civilians were massacred at Satichaura Ghat. In return Britishers later killed Kanpur sepoys in the Bibighar massacre.
