---

In June 2023, Indian PM Modi made a state visit to the US White House. The Joint Statement released by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/22/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-india/">White House</a> as well as the <a href="https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/36711/IndiaUSA+Joint+Statement+during+the+Official+State+visit+of+Prime+Minister+Shri+Narendra+Modi+to+USA">Ministry of External Affairs, India</a>, highlighted cooperation between the two democracies on wide-ranging issues. The gist I have analysed from it is presented in this article :

### Nature of Partnership 

U.S.-India Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership  
Democracy  
Freedom  
Rule of law  
Human rights  
Partnership of democracies  


### Indo-Pacific as a theatre of cooperation

Indo-Pacific - Strategic Convergence in the Indo-Pacific - for Maritime domain awareness - SOP for HADR  
Prime Minister Modi welcomed the United States joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and President Biden welcomed India’s continued participation as an observer in the Partners in the Blue Pacific  
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)   
India-U.S Commercial Dialogue  
Indian Ocean Rim Association  
Blue Dot Network   
Multilateral and regional groupings  
Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) - to contribute toward a free, open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient   Indo-Pacific... 4 democracies...It doesn’t need to be inclusive in its membership because it’s inclusive in its agenda. Unlike other multi-national formulations, Quad does not have a head-honcho nation even when the four democracies are of different sizes, with different national and economic problems to resolve.... The Quad is one of the most prominent examples of Asia’s ‘new minilateralism’... wide-ranging agenda( relief to tech to security)


### Defense cooperation

Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap ... eg. "coproduction" of Tejas GE engines by Tejas & HAL (full ToT)  
annual “2+2” Ministerial Dialogue  
Innovation Bridge - to connect defence startups of both nations (to link the startup ecosystems of the two countries)  
India’s emergence as a hub for maintenance and repair for forward deployed U.S. Navy assets  
U.S.-India Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) - a network of universities, startups, industry and think tanks  
MQ9 (Reaper) UAV of General Atomics US... primarily for ISR (helpful in LoC/LAC) (much cost-effective cf. P8 manned naval aircraft) & secondarily for attack (nb. MQ1 ie. Predator used Hellfire missiles after 9/11)
