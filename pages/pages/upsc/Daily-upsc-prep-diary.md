**12th August 2021**

This world is non-sense and I've known it. Don't give a dime about any goddamn person, all are useless except few rarities. With this crude lesson of life I start my preparation for UPSC-CSE. If I am able to crack this exam, there's a shore of opportunities on the other side : respect, power, resources and sources, and an ability to truly do something big. If the perilous seas stop me from making the other side, then my life shall wast in shallows and miseries. I'd rather drown in harness within the platoons of the savage sea, than waste my potential in this bullshit clerical shallows. Thus my preparation for UPSC starts. 

Along the west coasts of the continents, the cold ocean currents flow toward the equator in both hemispheres (due to coriolis force). Therefore, tropical cyclones originate in the east coast of continents where temperature is 27 deg C or above.  
Although the temperature conditions are favourable at equator but tropical cyclones are absent. This is due to absence of coriolis force at equator which is a prerequisite for circulatory motion of air towards a low pressure centre, anticlockwise in northern hemisphere and clockwise in southern hemisphere (coriolis).Therefore, the tropical cyclones originate and develop most frequently between 10 deg and 20 deg latitudes.  
The upper troposphere (8 to 15 km) just above the surface disturbance must have well developed divergence or anticyclonic circulation to pump out the ascending air currents and to maintain continuous supply from below.  
  
Originally, the Constitution of India did not make any provision with respect to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. Later, the States Reorganization Commission (1953-55) made a recommendation in this regard.
Accordingly, the Seventh Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956 inserted a new Article 350-B in Part XVII of the Constitution. This article contains the following provisions: There should be a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.
He/she is to be appointed by the President of India. It would be the duty of the Special Officer to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the Constitution.
He/she would report to the President . It must be noted here that the Constitution does not specify the qualifications, tenure, salaries and allowances, service conditions, and procedure for removal of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.
In pursuance of the provision of Article 350-B of the Constitution, the office of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities was created in 1957. He/she is designated as the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities.He falls under the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Hence, he reports to the President through the Union Minority Affairs Minister
The Commissioner has his headquarters at New Delhi. He/she has regional offices at Belgaum, Chennai , Kolkata and Prayagraj.  
  
  nhrc... chairman apptd by presi............shrc chairman.. apptd by guv.........but both can be removed only by presi on pm/incap grounds on inquiry of SC.........tenure 3 yrs/70 yrs age  
    
 Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not extend to the
following:
(a) A dispute arising out of any pre-Constitution treaty, agreement, 
(b) A dispute arising out of any treaty, agreement,
(c) Inter-state water disputes (The Inter-State Water Disputes Act of 1956 has excluded this power)
(d) Matters referred to the Finance Commission.
(e) Adjustment of certain expenses and pensions between the Centre and the
states.
(f) Ordinary dispute of Commercial nature between the Centre and the states.
(g) Recovery of damages by a state against the Centre.
High Court to Supreme Court appeal......for civil case, certificate of reference always required from high court...in serious criminal cases, no certificate required.
Also in constitutional cases, a certificate from HC is required as in civil cases  
  
102nd CAA,2018 constitutionalized NCBC (ins Art 338B) and added Art 342A making Presi the authority to make state-wise lists of SEBCs/OBCs (like 341 & 342 for sc and st resp).

By 105th CAA,2021 amended Art 342A to allow State govt also for SEBCs (sc and st still with presi).  
Sebc..by goi..now state also
Obc..by state for state govt job  
  
👉Constant environments promote niche specialization and lead to a greater species diversity. The inclined axis of earth's rotation leads to more seasonal variation in Temperate areas and less seasonal variations in Equatorial areas and hence greater species diversity in Equatorial areas as compared to Temperate areas. There is more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to higher productivity; this, in turn, might contribute indirectly to greater diversity  
  
Presently Saka year 1943 & Vikram samvat 2079 is going on  

Earth rotates West to East. Jet Streams also move west to east, but faster than earth's west-east movt. (since air is lighter so conserv of momentum)!Tropical Easterly Jet Stream is a temporary jet srream which blows in June-Sept only & strengthens monsoons from upper troposhere. Its cause is likely the extreme hotness of Tibetan plateau which creates low pressure even upto upper troposhere. TEJ strengthens Indian monsoon.

G7 2021..... decision to ratify a 15% floor rate on corporate tax in member countries...since corporates register themselves in tax havens which causes heavy loss to other nations... 22% to 15% done in india in 2020 which is one of the lowest in asia...also ref minm alternate tax...dtaa needed, tiea needed.. us has 28% under biden

Blind people can use echolocation to improve their ability to navigate using clicking noises either from their mouth, walking cane taps or footsteps. They sense return sound like bats (though humans use sonic rather than ultrasonic like bats). Thus they can create a mental map of their surroundings (just like a lidar map). But several years of training is required. Plus there's social stigma of making clicking sounds in public.

There are four major grand slam tournaments in lawn tennis, organized by ITF. Starting from the year-beginning, there is the Australian Open, then the French Open (Roland Garros)(clay court), Wimbledon (grass court), and the US Open. Winning all 4 in one's career is termed a 'Career Grand Slam'. Only few players have that distinction.
The ATP Finals/WTA Finals and the Davis Cup/Fed Cup are other important tournaments. And ofcourse, we also have Tennis in the Summer Olympics !

### Classification of food items for GST
Most food items, especially those of essential and unprocessed nature, are charged nil GST.
But processed foods attract higher rates of 5%, 12%, or 18% depending on the food product.
For instance, pappad, Bread (branded or otherwise), are charged zero GST, but pizza bread is charged 5% GST.
Heading 1905 under the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System classifies pizza bread, khakhra, plain chapati or roti, rusks, toasted bread in one category, for which a 5% GST rate is levied.
Similarly, in the ready for consumption category, unbranded namkeens, bhujia, mixture and similar edible preparation attract 5% GST, while such branded namkeen, bhujia, mixture attract 12% GST.

nb. Newspapers containing advertising material has 0% GST rate. However, ads attract 5% GST, not the newspapers publishing them. Newspapers with or without advertisements are exempted from GST.



The National Flag is ‘hoisted’ on Independence Day (August 15) and ‘unfurled’ on Republic Day (January 26).
In January 1912, the song Jana Gana Mana was first published in Tattvabodhini Patrika titled as ‘Bharat Vidhata’.
The Constituent Assembly decided to formally adopt Jana Gana Mana as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950.
On Independence Day, the Prime Minister of India hoists the flag at the Red Fort in New Delhi. On the other hand, the Republic Day ceremony of unfurling the flag by the President of India takes place at Rajpath in the national capital.

Lets understand the evolution of the governing apparatus of India during the British Raj, especially the first half of the 20th century.
Till 1853 the GG executive council discharged the legislative functions as well with the help of some external experts and commissions. The Charter Act 1853 established a mini-legislature within the GG council. There was no legislature in the councils though. This was the phase of centralization. After the 1857 revolt, the Councils Act were a period of decentralization. The Indian Councils Act 1861 established the Imperial Legisaltive Council. It was unicameral and completely nominated. The Indian members wre called non-official members. Over the years its size increased. but it was only in 1909 that some members in it were "elected" from the Prov. leg. councils (though prov.leg. councils were themselves nominated bodies :). Such indirect elections were started with separate electorate for Muslims under the IC Act 1909. The Prov. leg. assemblies were increased in 1861 and their legislative powers restored. The decentralization continued throughout the IC period. Like Imperial leg. council, they were also fully nominated bodies.

### Food security in India :

Macro and micronutrients...hunger and hidden hunger  
Food security means the supply of adequate food to all (either through domestic prod or imports)  
National food security act 2013..right to food..pds system  
WTO's Agreement on agriculture (3 pillars- DME). How reducing "subsidies" (->which WTO calls AMS), esp Domestic subsidies (eg. msp & cheap farm inputs), can hamper farmers and thus food security also.
India's poor performance in the Global Hunger Index (4 parameters)
Low protein diet is a specific issue of India (low macronutrient intake in general is an issue though)
Causes of food insecurity : dep on monsoons whicha are erratic, less developed microirrigation needed for better productivity of horticulture, middleman(paikar) system which results in low farmer income, bpl calc is not perfect and differs state to state..so some apl are unable to get pds properly, low pvt sector involvement in agri sector, pandemic effects and migrant labor crisis, high population & shrinking land & landholding in India, low productivity

Way forward: more pvt sector involvement, investment/credits to develop infra for agri-marketing & food processing, revised bpl calculation/survey, one nation one ration card, aadhar seeding of ration cards,  doubling farmers income, agri rforms will also thus help in food supply reforms (so mention agri points :)), concessions from wto on AoA (eg peace clause), increasing the basket of pds foods

Internet fast lanes violate net neutrality. Egs of violation of net neutrality : Airtel zero, Facebook basics, internet.org  ... nb. India doesnt have any law to enforce net neutrality (even IT Act doesnt talk about it).. only a TRAI order enforces it somewhat

parallel computing is breaking up a task into smaller pieces and executing those pieces at the same time, each on their own processor or computer

**Polarization**
By considering light as an electromagnetic wave, we realize that in three-dimensional space a wave can oscillate up and down, side to side, or anywhere in between. Incandescent, fluorescent, LED, and many laser light sources are randomly polarized. In other words, the oscillating angle or plane of light from each point on the light source is varying with time. Taken as a time average, therefore, randomly polarized light sources continuously output all angles of polarization.

Polarizers absorb incident light oscillating in all but one plane - its polarization axis - yielding linear polarization. Another example of polarization is the partial polarization of light reflecting from a plane surface, an effect less dramatic than a polarizer element. Linear polarization of a randomly polarized light source reduces the intensity of the source theoretically by 50%, and in practice closer to 60-65%. Light that passes through two polarizers with orthogonal polarizing axes will be completely attenuated. 

LCD displays, which can be found in a cockpit, emit polarized light. Therefore, polarized sunglasses reduce the ability to read those LCD displays. ... Also a pilot with polarized sunglasses on could fail to see a shimmer of glare given off by another aircraft's windscreen.

In DNA computing, information is represented using the four-character genetic alphabet ATGC rather than the binary alphabet.
A file can be stored in a vial where dna molecules are floating around in solution. you can send it to a alab to retrieve data slowly. So its currently used as a abackup to a abackup to store very secret info..since its expensive now.
The DNA computers can make a high amount of parallel computation but they have very slow processing speed.

2.4 ghz freq of bt, wifi, 4g internet, etc implies data is transmitted in the 2.40-2.48 ghz freq band.

Lifi transmits in visible light range and not in radiowaves.Li-Fi is high security benefits. Light communication can’t be intercepted unlike electromagnetic waves. So interference is also less. Hence its secure mode of communication. Since light can’t pass through obstacles like walls and barriers, Li-Fi can’t work beyond it. It limited to visible range of light.

Why data tariffs are low in India...due to hyper competition..telcos' profit margin decreased from 30% to 5% after jio 4g launched in 2016

#### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD works by transmitting millions of polarized light particles (photons) over a fiber optic cable from one entity to another. Each photon has a random quantum state, and collectively all the photons create a bit stream of ones and zeros.
When the photons arrive at the endpoint, the receiver uses beam splitters (horizontal/vertical and diagonal) to “read” the polarization of each photon. The receiver does not know which beam splitter to use for each photon and has to guess which one to use. After the receiver tells the sender which beam splitter was used for each of the photons in the sequence they were sent, the sender then compares that information with the sequence of polarizers used to send the photons. The photons that were read using the wrong beam splitter are discarded, and the resulting sequence of bits becomes a unique optical key that can be used to encrypt data.

What makes QKD unbreakable?
The security of QKD stems from the ability to detect any intrusion on the QKD transmission. Because of the unique and fragile properties of photons, any third party (or eavesdropper) who tries to read or copy the photons in any way will change the photons’ state.

The change will be detected by the endpoints, alerting them that the key has been tampered with and must be discarded. A new key is then transmitted. Moreover, since the keys generated are truly random, they are protected from future hacking attempts.

QKD can be used to send secure data. The networks which use such keys are called "Quantum networks"

"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the only provably secure communication method because it uses physics – not math – to encrypt data"

VPN is a private network within the public internet which separates the user’s traffic from the rest of a public or shared network. A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. A remote worker, who may be working from home, could need to connect to their company’s internet or restricted applications by using VPN.
