We’re all living an unrehearsed mission called life. This mission may also be considered as a battle against passive weaknesses that you need to fight and conquer. Unlike others who think of it as commonplace, I feel the most interesting and unique aspect of life is that you don’t know what will happen tomorrow or anytime in future. Of course there are days when our planning, discipline and predictable work environment enables us to forecast tomorrow’s schedule with a fair degree of accuracy. For example, a student appearing in a series of exams for his boards knows that tomorrow’s test timetable will be similar to today’s. But most days are otherwise. 
Man by nature is attracted to predictability in life. That’s why he turned from nomadic to a settled species; that’s why he looks for general rules to fit in; and that’s why rules and standards have become the central pillar of today’s management, science and law.  Set patterns have made life much easier.
To me, planning and patternizing your life depends on just one habit : Discipline. And just like other habits, you need to develop it through sustained practice. There is a dilemma however that you need discipline in order to practice discipline, making it a virtuous cycle of excellence.
