Refer to this figure of the Eisenhower Decision Matrix:

I believe that if you spend most of your day doing the blue tasks that you should ideally delegate, you're screwed. You're in the wrong job, wrong environment and you're "poor". In that case, your orange quadrant will remain pending. On the other hand, if you're able to consistently and happily dispose of the orange tasks, you're "rich".  


If frustration (ùêπ) is proportional to the difference between your skill set (S) and your job profile requirement (J), we can express it as:

\\[
\( F \propto (S-J) \)
\\]

You can reduce your frustration by either increasing J, or keeping a low S. Both S and J are in your hands. But if you relinquish its control to some third party: parents, tutors, financiers or the government, you will be permanently trapped in mediocrity and middle class. Nobody's gonna live your life for you. You must dream and execute your dream vide your own enterprise. Lock in, push through pain and shed all the softness that sticks to you like a tick.
