Traditional lecture-based education is becoming outdated. Active education including roundtable-based collaborative projects and data-driven insights with real world applicablity will dominate classrooms. Virtual support through Slack-like digital workspaces will replace most non-lab based learning and interaction.  

With simultaneous rise of Aging & GenZ cohorts, future workforces will become more multigenerational. Diversity will increase anyway. GenZ have different expectations and values compared to their predecessors, prioritizing work-life balance, flexibility, and purpose-driven work. Students thus need to be taught how to communicate and lead with more decentralised mindset from a young age itself.  

AI can help personalize learning experience for each individual. Each student can set their targets and the curriculum and timeline can be tailored. This will ease the process of allowing exceptional students to complete a higher degree at a much younger age (and vice-versa). Skilling will be integrated into the educational ecosystem with tokenised microcredits. Fixed-timeline course completions will transform into fixed-achievement metrics, bypassing assessment measurements due to super-rapid pace of progress in the educational evolution.
