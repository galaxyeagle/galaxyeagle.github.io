I just finished reading the book "Open", the autobiography of former world number one tennis player Andre Agassi. The book provides a candid and open account of his personal life, struggles, and successes.

My overview of the book's storyline:

### Andre Agassi's Tennis Career

- He was world number one for 30 weeks straight in 1995.
- The book highlights his reign as a top player before the era of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.

### Openness about Personal Life

- The book is titled "Open" because it reflects both the open tournaments in tennis (e.g., Australian Open, French Open) and Andre Agassi's openness about his personal life.
- He shares not only his success stories but also his failures, struggles, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities.
- This openness is uncommon among public figures.

- It explores his transition to post-retirement life, including spending time with family and pursuing hobbies.
- Writing this autobiography shows that he is open to new avenues in life.

### Critical Analysis

- The book begins with Andre Agassi's preparation for the last match of his career at the US Open in 2006.
- He describes how he struggled physically due to age-related issues and a condition called spondylolisthesis.
- Throughout the book, he chronologically recounts his childhood, training under his father's guidance, and becoming a professional tennis player.
- Despite being successful in tennis, Andre Agassi reveals that he had a bittersweet relationship with the game. He often hated it but was deeply invested due to it being his profession.
- The book delves into his personal problems, including depression, multiple marriages, and a positive drug test for crystal meth.
- It also highlights the importance of enduring relationships and finding solace in family life.



## Life-lessons I personally learnt from the book:

### Passion as a Driving Force

- Agassi's recollection of his disciplined efforts made me remind of Mike Tyson's quote about discipline: â€œDiscipline is doing what you hate to do, but doing it like you love it."
- Even if one hates their profession, having passion for it is crucial for excelling.

### Overcoming Obstacles

- Andre Agassi's journey: He faced health problems, bad habits, fragile relationships, and failures.
- Despite setbacks, he bounced back and fought until his last match.
- Fame and money can be unexciting without knowing how to channelize success.
- Confusion, uncertainty, and insecurity can lead to hating what one does.


### Seeking Happiness Beyond Fame

- Andre Agassi found happiness in the love of his family and helping others.
- He decided not to force his children into tennis but promote education instead.
- He established an academy for underprivileged children in Las Vegas.


### Role of Parents and Coaches

- Coach Gil Reyes served as a father figure and mentor who imparted valuable lessons beyond sports.
