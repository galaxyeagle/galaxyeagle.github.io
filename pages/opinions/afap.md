<button onclick="expand('liston2')"> Liston 1965  </button>   <span id="liston2" style="display:none"> 1. Ali was too fast for Liston in the 2nd fight. Sonny felt like he was surrounded until a punch came from nowhere and knocked 		him down. Ali showed that punching power is not an indispensable ingredient of a knock-out. He proved it again in his fight with 
    Jurgen Blin. Ali's punches were like an avalanche, a single one may be insufficient but a cumulation can crumble mountains. You 
    initially feel that his jabs are bearable but by the time you realize the cumulative damage, its too late. Floyd Patterson once 
    remarked that Ali's punches won't knock you down, they'll rub you off and dizzy you down. He was right.</span>

					observation, this fight contributed the most to his slowing down and Parkinson-like symptoms later on. His speech started slurring 
					only after this fight. The last round of this bout is one of the best and reveals the warrior-spirit of Ali. -- contributed by @Raman Butta</span>
