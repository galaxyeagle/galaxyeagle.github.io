You can get access to a product or service through 4 ways : 

1. By paying for it  
2. By being member of a club.  
3. By trading your time/attention (eg. via ads).  
4. By requesting others.

This is the modern fourfold caste system (in order). 

And even when you gain access, logistic friction will come up depending on your location, accessories you own, and your knowledge of leveraging that product into something bigger. 

In fact beyond the four modern castes, the world is divided into thousands of concentric circles of social classes: the modern version of jati. Theyâ€™re arranged like concentric onion rings leading to the peak of the socioeconomic hill: the innermost ring, i.e. the king.

People keep striving to transcend rings of these social classes throughout their life. Sometimes it takes many generations to cross over to the next ring. For some, a quantum leap across hundreds of rings happens within a single generation. Some others like Napolean or Elon manage to jump from the outermost rings to the very innermost within a lifetime.
