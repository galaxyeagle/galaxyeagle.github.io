title: Hollow craze for the IAS

Young people in India are still crazy to join the civil services for the following reasons:

1. Family pressure.   
2. To make connections and get things done in a prismatic society.  
3. To gain respect of the ignorant civilians.  
4. To stick their head above the ugly mob (breaking the middle class trap) without entrepreneurship.  
5. Anti-meritocratic job security and promotions.  
6. To ***.  

They do get these but additionally also end up :

1. Acting like a safe and reliable conduit of *** for politicians.  
2. Simultaneously becoming modern-day slaves of the political executive and masters of the apolitical middle class.   
3. Perpetrating a toxic work culture and freely transmitting the immoral pressure from politicians down to their juniors.  
4. Having a false superiority complex in an era where clearly the professionals and technocrats are much superior.  
5. Losing touch with market reality and the emerging skill-sets of future.  
6. Becoming a WhatsApp addict and sociopath, while raising their children with fake luxuries like government vehicles.  
7. Frustration, because the reality of the job is <<< the expectation of an aspirant.  


In short, its a pity that the hype around IAS/IPS has lasted so long. The government shields this service from market competition and creates a protected chamber of mediocrity on stilts of taxpayers’ money. The IAS officers are some of the most mediocre and indolent people I’ve ever met, who managed to clear the tough entrance exam with a one-time effort that I respect but which this job doesn’t. For those “good” officers who feature on thebetterindia.com for their good work despite political pressure, disasters and poor infrastructure, I would say that if you’re really that enterprising from within, and not just on outside, this job is not for you. Go hone your skills, compete in the open market just like you did in the Civil Services Exam and contribute from the plateau of evolving merit, not from an unquestionable cadre of ivory towers. Thankfully, technology is reducing the monopoly, opacity and authority of government and bureaucracy every passing year. So better ride a promising boat than a sinking ship, where the captain drowns deeper than the crew. And in case the boat is too humiliating for you, prepare for extinction.
