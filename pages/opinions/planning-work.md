“Thomas returned back to his office at the stroke of dusk. He was exhausted. The empty files strewn upon the cluttered table reminded him that the required data wasn’t collected yet. He had failed to utilise the first half mainly due to his own and his team’s inexperience and laxity. He dedicated the post-lunch session to field work and data collection, but with poor results.

Grappling with helplessness, fatigue, unmet goals and an unforgiving tomorrow, Thomas was looking for a shoulder to either stand upon or to cry on. But there was nobody in the big office, except for the carefree night-guard looking for a sweet spot to retire till daybreak.

Thomas could see no light at the end of the tunnel. His boss would not spare him tomorrow morning. How would he face him? Where can he escape? Nowhere.”

This is just a hypothetical example I made up to illustrate firstly poor organisational planning and then unrealistic deadlines. Proper planning and training resolves 90% of all problems. Poor planning leads to drudgery and anxiety. And then people complain about work-stress!
