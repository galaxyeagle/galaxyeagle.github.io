title: The psychology of exploitation

In an office, work pressure is given on the employee who is both weak and efficient. This combination ensures that maximum work can be extracted with minimum resistance. The same mentality dominated the days of the Industrial Revolution where factory workers were exploited because they were weak, being compromised on many fronts. Firstly, the workers had left farming and had no better alternative except working in the factory. Secondly, the magnetic pull towards urban areas and fear of retreating back to countryside deadened their spine. And thirdly, the ever dangling carrot of wage hikes and stick of penalty kept them obedient servants to their fat masters. It was weakness at these fronts which allowed for squeezing work out of them at the cost of their own dreams, health and well-being. 
The same mentality dominates today as well. The only difference is that there are far more carrots to allure and intoxicate you today than they were then; and though there are more alternatives available today, the competition in each is much higher. Even today, the majority have forgotten the importance of personal skills in the face of organisational rote work. Even today, the majority are hooked on choice postings in jobs. Even today the carrots of false respect, power and money have made asses out of humans, running endlessly through the rat race of modern slavery at the cost of their own dreams, and on a bigger note at the cost of civilisational leaps.
