title: What I learnt from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Incerto series

Taleb's writings talk about Black Swan Events which are unpredictable shocks (like the fat-tails of a Gaussian curve) eg. the Covid pandemic or the AI revolution. A lot of them are knightian uncertainties which, unlike "risks", are immeasurable because of lack of historical data. Many of these events might be nonlinear with small changes leading to large effects. Patterned approaches as per the law of large numbers would fail in such cases. The 'Be water' philosophy of Bruce Lee helps clear such hurdles. Fragile ones crumble and go extinct under the weight of the change-wave. But it's the anti-fragile, darwinian, cold-blooded, machiavellian and teleological Fat Tonies who ride and thrive on the wave.
