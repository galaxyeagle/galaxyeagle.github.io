It's seven years 
without you by my side

Our cities changed
And the world's too different 
But we are still
The same

Never found out
What I looked for
Pain is all
that remains

-------------------------

This vibe 
This season 
The birds flying high in space

Same words
Same reason
The emptiness stares away

I know I know why o why
The lord is playing games
Testing if my thoughts can sing
a song today
a song today
a song today 

---------------------------------

This morning rain
There's something that I can feel 
will come again
I wait here night and day

For all those trips and memories 
Those unsaid words in your stories
The younger faces, younger love
I see alone now from above
Like a deathless desperation
impossible resurrection 
I'm slipping into sorrow
You'll find me through tomorrow
Until you come back to me
Come back to me
