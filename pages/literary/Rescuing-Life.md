Life was thought to be an easy game  
But as I grew I found it not the same  
as childhood days are left by  
and swapped with a sullen cry  
How hard was it to break  
with a time that had no stakes  
And so I walked the halls  
And I strove the streets  
with a heart that’s dreamy in mortal beats.  
And I made my way  
through night and day  
in a future that I often wished to be  
But my eyes still wander   
to a land I conjure  
where magic was a part of me  
I could sing with the breeze  
with the brooklet meander  
with the sparrows fly through the trees  
There would be a time  
I’d always talk in rhyme  
And run on flying feet  
The bright sunshine  
like a painting in the sky  
would welcome the day for me.  
O please   
If I can’t get back to that  
may I draw strength from my dreams  
to a glorious range expand  
where I ride the rescued land.
