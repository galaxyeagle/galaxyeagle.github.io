Mediocrity swarms the surface
Dense froth swell the shores
Lowly weed engreen to choke
the rich fish beneath.
Hyenas laugh and the lion cries
while rest chuckle at his despair.


Long years drain to fill
the abyss of human injustice
until justice turns sterile.
Means, not merit, dictate hierarchy
where talent is a barren ground
to seeds of recognition.
Logic fails and labour fails,
And yet within this blinding black
before the fading sun of west
The lion fights with unmoved calm
It walks the proud path designed
by righteousness and dogged sweat,
by scholarly acuity
and depth of million miles.
The lion bleeds but never tastes regret.
