<!--
Mediocrity swarms the surface <br>
Dense froth swell the shores <br>
Lowly weed engreen to choke  <br>
the rich fish beneath. <br>
Hyenas laugh and the lion cries<br>
whilst rest chuckle at his despair. <br>


Long years drain to fill<br>
the abyss of human injustice <br>
until justice turns sterile. <br>
Means, not merit, dictates hierarchy <br>
where talent is a barren ground<br>
to seeds of recognition.<br>
Logic fails and labour fails, <br>
And yet within this blinding black<br>
before the fading sun of west <br>
The lion fights with unmoved calm<br>
It walks the proud path designed<br>
by righteousness and dogged sweat,<br>
by scholarly acuity <br>
and depth of million miles. <br>
The lion bleeds but never tastes regret.<br>
