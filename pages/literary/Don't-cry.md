title: Don't cry

I know  
your pain  
and the stillness that fills you  
Your floating eyes remind me  
of horrors that once saddled me deep  
though now washed off in waves of time.  

Why do you fall O friend ?  
You are known to be immune to gloomy forces  
I am used to see you in the warrior's robe  
and fight like Tipu or Lakshmibai  
all alone yet more spirited than a crew of normal folk  
Redeem that originality, turn back the hands of time  
Rescue your fleeting definition.  
That look on you is like unfitting fear on the brow of a lion.  

Look up  
the world's not lost  
It beckons you to fly your steel  
beneath the sinking sun  
in the face of pulling pains.  

- Raman Butta
