<h1> Don't Cry </h1> 

Date : 2021-03-23 <br><br>

I know  <br>
your pain  <br>
and the stillness that fills you  <br>
Your floating eyes remind me  <br>
of horrors that once saddled me deep  <br>
though now washed off in waves of time.  <br><br>

Why do you fall O friend ?  <br>
You are known to be immune to gloomy forces  <br>
I am used to see you in the warrior's robe  <br>
and fight like Tipu or Lakshmibai  <br>
all alone yet more spirited than a crew of normal folk  <br>
Redeem that originality, turn back the hands of time  <br>
Rescue your fleeting definition.  <br>
That look on you is like unfitting fear on the brow of a lion.  <br><br>

Look up  <br>
the world's not lost  <br>
It beckons you to fly your steel  <br>
beneath the sinking sun  <br>
in the face of pulling pains. <br>
