<h1> Journey through the windy lanes </h1> 

Date : 2021-04-23 <br><br>

I count the the passing cars  <br>
plying the dull highway.   <br>
The wind is as dusty as it gets.  <br>
The unhappy firmament smokes in scary clouds.   <br>
I get teary from the incense that pours off the smith shop;  <br>
I run for life, the road seems to fall down an abyss of darkness.   <br>
I have plans, yet I have to go where the road leads me, there are no byways.   <br>
The violet rain drizzles till I can see no further than a yardstick.   <br>
My feet are numbed and I fall on my knees: yet I crawl, for the clock ticks. I rise up each time.   <br>
A car or two pass again : happy faces peeping through the wipering panes. Some having quarrels going within. Some sobbing.   <br>
A frail old man rests his hand on my shoulder and offers help. I'm startled.   <br>
Whence did he come? How can he help?   <br>
He points towards his ramshackle van.   <br>
Soon I'm several miles through and reach the lighted streets of a shabby town.   <br>
Its no paradise, but I've escaped hell.  <br><br>

The town is packed with shops  <br>
But no shop is too big   <br>
Pedestrians throng the breadths of streets  <br>
and loaded bikes lace through.   <br>
No beggars can be seen around  <br>
No frail man plods the way  <br>
I pass through the market like a brook of breeze, with no rolls to spend along.   <br>
The other side of town is a family of houses  <br>
People seem to have limitless hours of leisure   <br>
I feel at home unless I talk with some:  <br>
for then I discover the distant stars of otherness to be shallow pools of triviality.   <br>
Discomfort gently seeps into my bones  <br>
as my vision sprawls  <br>
beyond the straits of dreary days.   <br>
When efforts don't yield the fruits they earn;  <br>
and are snarled in blinding chains:  <br>
a new breed of temperament evolves  <br>
a dogged shield and sword.  <br>
Labour soon decrypts the gordian knot of mediocrity   <br>
and lights up the road to fortune;   <br>
And thus I ride the occult way  <br>
like an eagle through the bolts.   <br>
