So many a brilliant plan he has
And momentous ideas apart
Yet experience in ambition swells
And blinds a modest start.

How well is he equipped in words
To once be master flown
The most terrific globes of snow
Begin with a small little stone.

And yet he feels that he can do
Aft all the loss of yore
Compared to all the one time win
A fast beginning is more.
