title:  Melting Rainbow's Radiance

The melting rainbow's radiance,  
hidden violet topp'd:  
peeping from the whisper of the ruckling sun,  
with face ablazed.  
A skylark wingspread and singspread with bristled blue cap passes it;  
and the protected heart within those hues,  
more conspicuous than itself.  
O, its soft spirit disintered:sweeter than the thirst-quenching juice of Gulab-Jamun.  
Him abed, it sheerly fades-like golden butter vulcanized,  
till drop aft drop it dies,  
soaked into feathered messengers:  
that slumbers their wink of eye  
-till wet with with sleepful zephyrs,  
drain them in their cups;  
till from overflowing goblets sprinkled refreshful twilight's spirit:  
and their honeycomb throat's clog is burnt.
