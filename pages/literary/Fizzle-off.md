A heavy heart, a tender mind  
a ruthless world to face  
Each day departs   
in dull demise  
in silent sobs that bleed and dry out  
until they’re ‘cised again.  
Helpless eyes gaze heartless men  
and drooping heads don’t fight a war  
For half the puissance’s inner grit  
and half the grit is hope.  
The mute sun pleads for justice fair  
and burns in waves of fire.  
Ugly heads with garlands dress  
and beauty rots in mire.  

The storm cannot last forever  
neither can clear skies  
The bites of frost do stay for life  
unhealed by brief summers.  
Such chronic tribulations are bred  
by decisive mistakes.  
You burn your own fingers  
to lead you out of the maze  
to reach the cross earlier than competitors   
to gather more treasures on your way.  
If each pebble and jewel collected   
and nursed in childish care;  
Each unmet promise and distant lake  
which thrums your heart with overdependance  
through the drought of sandy dunes  
is lost in the callous wind,  
shan’t you feel doors closed on your face  
making you crumble down,  
sterile to breed new hope?  

Today the world is more hobbesian  
than Hobbes could ever think  
How funny and how sad that men  
burn in a sea of flames  
Yet thinking the shore to be hotter  
Go deeper in the waves  

Let them go.  
Humanity is foolishly independent   
to steer its way to hell   
Liberty is a joke  
Equality as a word is misused  
to cook an injustice   
which fades inequality a hundred shades lighter.  
Let it happen.  
Let the world sink into self-destruction.  
Let climate-change drown all continents.  
Let appeasement make most clans extinct.  
Let neglect and rattraps make talent   
and morality evolve into a lower species.  
And then let’s improve the chimps.  
Lets reck and hew our civilisation.  
Lets make peace bloodier than war  
Smiles crueler than frowns  
Freedom more clutched than bondage  
News more vicious than ignorance   
And life more futile than death.  
Lets kill each other  
put spanners in the wheels of our teammates  
and then compete with other teams   
just to display our fake single-handedness.  
Lets create a diseased society  
Lets spread contagion  
So that everyone is suspicious of everyone else   
And the poor happily feed on crumbs for meals  
And tents for houses  
And water for milk  
thus becoming parties to the crime.  
Let it stay, let it fall.  
The tiger’s jaws seem mesmerising   
until they prick your throat, and when they do so,  
cry till your lungs are dry  
and call for help  
to a commune of enemies,  
until you’re lost in haze.
