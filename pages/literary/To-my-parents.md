I was wandering alone  
thinking of my sweet home  
For what is worth in this life  
if not the peace of mind  
What is worth in this game  
today  
If not for you is it wise  
to make all this sacrifice  
and live and die like stones  
each day  

If God gives me his wand  
I would conquer this land  
and gift it to my parents and say  
that I love you from the depths  
of the bottom of my heart  
and there's never that I could repay  
for all the effort that you poured  
in my progress and growth  
How you nurtured me in the shadow zone of pain  

Oh how when ungenerous men  
half human, half satan,  
would have crushed me before you made me a lion.  
And now that nasty mob  
stands in fear of my face  
which bows before your feet each day.  
With the iron you have cast  
in my soul and mind and heart,  
I can conquer seven oceans any day.  
So as I think of my home,  
by the midnight hearth that smokes,  
there is nothing further that I'd say.
