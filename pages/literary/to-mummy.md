Whenever seldom I make you happy  
it hurts me reminiscing all the times I miss’d this opportunity   
and let you down.  
When you smile, there ain’t any obligations of dementors I feel round me.  
When you’re proud of me, my heart weeps in joy unspoken, o’erflowin’ o’er my eyes.  
When you’re excited about anything coming, it rouses my dead soul into lively flames and makes me jump in my sleep.  
When you sing to me, this world leaves me and transports my mind into paradise.  
When you lull me to sleep, I feel the warmth of Sun in the bare coldness of space.  
When you cry, it feels a choking nightmare and a shiver through the nerve of my spirit.  
When you laugh, I witness the blessed light of God.  

I’m your child and nothing more.  
Your little boy till the seas wash the shore.  
Pardon me if I am late in realising truths.  
Pardon me if I’m late in executing dreams you knit in my golden slumbers.  
Pardon me if I disregarded your words and made you hurt.  
Pardon me if I went wrong and gambled out your gifts and deserted you in the storm.  
It’s not fitting of a man. The blunders were unforgivable.  
I know I don’t deserve your pardon by a dime, but still somehow you do, and love me unconditionally. I can’t understand.  

I can’t explain your love for me.   
For what so worthy have I done yet?  
You inflate the little honours I’ve achieved, and make it look like mountains.  
You deserved better.   
A million generations have one mother like you.  
I must’ve been a God in my last life to become your son.  
But you’ve taught me to look and conquer what lies before, and bury what’s behind.  
For that I will boil the oceans and mine the stars.  
I will scale mountains, and conquer greatness:  
and gift it to you.  
Each heartbeat of mine will beat for you.  
These are not frothy wishes, but promises of one drowned deep in your love and sacrifice.
