Hearts heavier than life  
sink in the spirit of this aerial blood;  
while many shaded birds only fly in this dusk,  
many only reflect  
and many only flutter innocent joy.  
For who would like a drink to be lonely  
and subtle from earthly possibilities  
to a place nowhere and a time no-known;  
for who would like to exchange the sun for moon,  
nay,for nothing;  
as future is due to be old in ickles of blinks,  
and decay in the ruthless furnace soon.  
Ay,I am not a citizen of Norway  
where stars alit the dusk temporarily;  
since every one is the king of his brain  
and the universe of his thoughts.  
Why then frown with a broken crown  
and vacantly upto the painless stain?
