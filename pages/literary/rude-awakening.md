The turn of tides, the twist of fates  
Aligns our future to my soul.  
Bare alleys down the nightly glades,  
Purpose-stricken ghastly strides,  
across the wailing lonely hills,  
sintering forgotten dreams  
and a heart burdened with rote,  
and eyes perplexed in confluence   
of mortal needs and godly goals,  
fill gaps of my dreaming ears   
and shake me up from sleep.
