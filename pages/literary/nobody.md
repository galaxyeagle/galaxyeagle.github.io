There’s nobody who will lift you up when you fall.  
There’s nobody who will be with you when you’re not with yourself.  
No one who will sleep, eat and walk for you;    
rescue you from drowning depths;  
pull you out of your own shadow;    
or show you the light of stars from the gutter-hole.   

You must thrive on zero energy,  
break inertia with internal force:    
blowing flame after flame on exhausted air,   
shining alone in a stretch of darkness;  
drawing water out of the veins of dry rocks;  
resourcing hope when it’s dead and forgotten;    
smiling even at the dance of death.
