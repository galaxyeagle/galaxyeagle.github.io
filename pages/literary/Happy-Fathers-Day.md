O papa, <br>
this little song is for you, <br>
for all your love and effort too; <br>
for when the troubled times were swallowing our smiles <br>
and fears were all around, <br>
you kept us safe and sound. <br>
And i realize today there's no way I can repay <br>
your love and pain. <br>
So now on this father's day I can just say to you: <br>
Thank you Papa you are leading me, <br>
your guidance leads me through. <br>
