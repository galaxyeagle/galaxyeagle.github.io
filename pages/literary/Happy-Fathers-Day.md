O papa,
this little song is for you,
for all your love and effort too;
for when the troubled times were swallowing our smiles
and fears were all around,
you kept us safe and sound.
And i realize today there's no way I can repay
your love and pain.
So now on this father's day I can just say to you:
Thank you Papa you are leading me, 
your guidance leads me through.
