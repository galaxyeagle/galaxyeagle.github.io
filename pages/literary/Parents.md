Parents are God in form of human-beings
their love can’t be measured in terms of other things 
Their care for us is more than what we require
They keep supporting us, they toil and perspire
Their gratitude is priceless, their advice is gold
Much wiser than us, no matter how old
But oft amid false friends and hollow joys
we don’t realise they love us till it cloys
And even if I claim that I do realise
Am I not moved to wipe my mother’s weeping eyes?
I think I love my parents but I must confess
I’m causing them more pain than disease and distress
So if you ask God for a gift, be thankful if he sends
Not friends or money or joy, but the guidance of parents.
