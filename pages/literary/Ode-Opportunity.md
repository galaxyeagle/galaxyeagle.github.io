The passion that fills and sweetens my blood  
boils untired in a fiery flood  
O take it a promise or a trance of myself  
to vanquish the bonds of moneyless pelf  
O opportunity, the magic of life  
how often you come, how often we strive  
How often you giveth, how seldom we take  
Pearls mask in risks that feebly we stake  
Ye bless me with power to sync with your call  
Blow down indolence, O mangle this pall  
Rouse up my spirit, fire my skill  
Put it to practice, to the peak of the hill.
