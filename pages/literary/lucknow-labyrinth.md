title:  INTO DOORS OF THE LUCKNOW LABYRINTH

I was in the beat of this worn maze  
trying to find ways out;  
and since 'twas nearly a half to midnight,  
it was mandatory to be stout;  
and in course of seconds I quivering slout  
for a flew of lame bat in haze;  
and Iregreted to refuse the help of light  
thinking my eyes to have a lioned sight  
in the unlit hour's gloomy face.  
And the moon was hid in the veil of a dense cloud,  
whilst time had lost its speech for nonce;  
and marking a funnel I held me bloat  
and slipped fro the unseen arch at once:              
ten different beasts did flaring flounce-              
I'd deep into the dead bat's crypt, and loud              
shreiking I craved to outgo that throat              
yet steadily over lethal unknowings I float              
and egested from a slimy door,  
I held me proud.  
And invisibly I shortened a longroute vain  
and yet reverted a once lost peace,  
for knowing  loss of mystery will be the fate  
if emergent glow of dawn unsees burial;  
midst through moonlight diffused like divine fleece,  
there ample a door before me fixed a stain  
and to pick and lead one I longstood wait
but after a truck of hours found I a solitary gate  
which I could lamelessly enter in no time or pain.
