Rise, O new day, the mighty Sun  
pulling itself out of the dungeons of defeat  
lights up the blck heavens  
and ignites hope in the dead Earth !  
Look how the wide-eyed bulbuls glide  
and sing in gush of golden glee;  
and how the shrubs white jasmines fleece,  
bedecking the silken morning breeze.  

How fresh and pure and inspiring  
the faith this new dawn breathes !  
HOw gory was the umbral night:  
our heroes fell, our Sun dissolved,  
and demons seized the Earth  
in hellish thunders, senseless din.  
But night is never permanent,  
no matther how much they seem.  
No pain or loss or disease  
can define or suppress you  
any longer than the night  
eclipses day.  

And when you emerge,  
you'll burn the dross to ashes  
and realize your gift of God;  
like the bold Sun burns the coldness of the dark skies  
and gives fresh life to all !
