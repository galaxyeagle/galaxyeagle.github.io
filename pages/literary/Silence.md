Silence also has a sound,   
loud and uniformly found;  
oft glacier in the lake,  
that silence had to make.  
A sound far from tone,  
which silence ne'er shone.  
A stain of unplay'd music,  
A trance of serene magic:  
a magic in verses pitch'd,  
as space in time is stitch'd;  
till time makes a classic din,  
and blood gives blood to the kiln.
