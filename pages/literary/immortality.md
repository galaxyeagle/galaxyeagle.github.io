Rain's drippin' midst fading lights,  
everything's so very nice;  
children of times yet to come  
shall savour the fruits of science.

Our woes, so strong, so much today,  
tomorrow will all melt away  
with the sweeping breath of time:  
and immortality find its way.

So strong, and brave, inexpugnable;  
so much, so very in existence:  
that man with words and health matchless  
succumbed to one assault of death.

And much has it left grief behind,  
much extinction for all time.  
Has not death yet paved his way  
to drown in the deepest tide ?

Long time a gay you lived, O death,  
and cut our lives full through;  
here under the illimitable skies  
I am pledged to murder you.  

Much have ye accomplished through age,  
much old ye have become.  
Much have ye thought thee immortal:  
shall now not dodge succumb.  

As highest peaks doth come the way  
and slow the trekker brave,  
roads have been paved and what is left  
is science digging your grave.
