I reach to the end of the show.
I hear the bubbling waves wash on the shore:
swept thin upon grey sands;
like solar winds blow bare the aerial lands.
Old friends have packed and passed,
and left without the usual warmth of past.
No one to share my grief
or stitch the wreckage of this reef.
Is it a mortal loss,
for no one is around or ever was ?
For all that left, I gained my dreams:
so long half clogged fuzzy frantic screams.
The sun undoes from bleeding crusts
rise from west and light the dusks.
I break last shards of rusted steel
and plunge in salt as I heal.
