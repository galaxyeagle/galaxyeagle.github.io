When I wake up from dreams
in world’s sharp interpose
A breath of brethren breeze
my bright windows unclose
It is a life I chose:
Rich lands of touchsome fire
and fictional desire.

When from my rest I stand
to the natural and strange light
of the world; with a magic wand
I think it’ll be all right
Yet I find I need to fight
for the daily crumbs of run
whilst the big job lies undone

When I from my peace am led
to the globe of crushing formality
composure chasms instead
in an unknown anxiety 
We feel that we are free
yet bound so much we are
we can’t lend solitude an hour.

We know not where we’re going
We blindly change our lanes
Betting on painted promises
or augury when it rains;
yet deep within our brains
there hides a wizard’s prowess
that opens in loneliness.
