O weariness
Melt away
The sunset fills my heart and soul

The foggy night,
Dusty gales
Darkness from the heavens pour

And I can see your face
In the distant haze
And I can hear your voice
All across the heights

Through the violet haze
By the distant daze
That rolls beneath
The starry sky

And I can feel that fire
That deep desire
The splendour of my dreams

Each word of sorrow
Shall be gone and tomorrow
Shall be bright as silver streams

And I can see
Forgotten dreams

And I can see
Forgotten dreams

See this morning sky
Sun is shinin high
You can breakout these shallow seas

You’re not yet old
Your blood ain’t cold
And you can paint this world with your dreams

That love was not in waste
Those sacrifices made
will conjure a beast unseen

I can sense your soul
dried with tears of old
full of fuel to fire your dreams

And I can see
Forgotten dreams
Forgotten dreams
Forgotten dreams
Forgotten dreams
And I can see, forgotten dreams.
