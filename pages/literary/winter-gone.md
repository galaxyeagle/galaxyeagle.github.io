The world is same, but I am not:  
I see it through newer eyes.  
One day again a bloody stain  
dries into the frozen air  
and beats the drums of horror  
in dreams of my nemesis.  
Look the pouring sky is melting:  
sulken, sullen, dark and dripping;  
all night and day unending.  

It matters not which gates of hell  
are gaping wide or locked in cages,  
streams of blood still rue the ridges  
and redden the eyes of heaven above.  

Mark my words, it ain't that nice;  
my every glory, every rise  
will poison you and mesmerise  
another smiling goblin twice.  
Come to me and I will teach:  
no lofty sermon blow or preach,  
but the knell of truth beseech  
unto your lazy ears.

I wonder where those clouds of doubt  
went so sparse and lit the air  
on every side. It scarcely seems  
to resemble the familiar illusion.
