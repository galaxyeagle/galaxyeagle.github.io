The world is frozen again
And my heart sits staring through the rain
This broken moment will slowly pass
Because the world is changing so fast

And when they mourn their dead, my heart sinks hard
When they cry in their painful dreams, complaining the silent skies

Then we fall, and we fall, and we fall to the ground 
There’s no escape, from this blind and struggling race, except that you stand out
Except you stand out
Except you stand out

The sky is dark, there rings a bell
to work like risen ghosts in hell
Live the story, day and night
Don’t stop till death, there’s no respite
You make your mark, you etch the stone
Keep fighting hard, and all alone
Ride it strong, all day and night
Don’t stop till death, there’s no respite 

Except you stand out from the crowd

And there is one way, just one way out
Just stay yourself and stand out from the crowd
Stay yourself and stand out from the crowd
