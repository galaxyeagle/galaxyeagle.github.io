The darkness still’d the solitude  
Midst many a brilliant machine  
The scientists complacent indeed  
With scope of time he’d seen.  

He switched the gear with a key  
Complying with his logic  
The sovereign laws expressed themselves  
In mathematical magic.

Full bright a light was shot to scene  
Like fire in solar rim   
The scientist obstructed the light  
And the light obstructed him.

Came now here to the distant hues  
Of futuristic time  
Which far from home and universe  
Did further future mime.

The fate of all the lands left by  
Will come to what I say  
The scientist did bewildered see  
What can’t be said today.

And then he saw the crimson sky  
Fill’d with a glossy gleaming glow   
And all a wireless universe  
Of current seemed to flow

The vitreous and spectral wind  
Overshadowed a cloudy prime  
He switched the gear with a key  
And forwarded further through time.

And then much upper fear in next stage  
Or some another fly   
Yet pragmatic he lit his ink  
In lands left far by.

He saw him and his grandfather  
Aft trailing the circle of seconds  
A lost voice once again did come  
Ambling in the carriage of winds.

Once again the glimmering crystals  
Hung from the throat of sky  
The bywent soul through dint of pen  
Now stood nearby.

As Drake from the sail of globe,  
Stopped the Golden Hind  
The scientist through the brilliant machines  
Watched the dawn unwind.
