title: Until all music fades

The pipeman puffs a solemn tune <br>
while pallies ring in ecstasy. <br>
The dusk reminds a passing morn <br>
of fate that drains the din. <br>
Quarrels unnecessary, greatness divorced <br>
from warrior's reins. <br>
Which way seeks't brother ? <br>
The day was high, the night is a soft <br>
collection of tired diversity. <br>
The moaning wind, why moan <br>
and weep your barrenness in my heart. <br>
So many untouched dreams <br>
washed away in midnight's tide, <br>
while tears streak the wishing eyes <br>
until all music fades. <br>
