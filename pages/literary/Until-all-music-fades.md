The pipeman puffs a solemn tune
while pallies ring in ecstasy.
The dusk reminds a passing morn
of fate that drains the din.
Quarrels unnecessary, greatness divorced
from warrior's reins.
Which way seeks't brother ?
The day was high, the night is a soft
collection of tired diversity.
The moaning wind, why moan
and weep your barrenness in my heart.
So many untouched dreams
washed away in midnight's tide,
while tears streak the wishing eyes
until all music fades.
