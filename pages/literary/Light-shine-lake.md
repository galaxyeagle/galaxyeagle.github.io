title: Light that shines across the lake

A streak of light is shining soft
Wandering in the autumn hills
I hear the deep rhythm
through the coloured clouds around.
They disappear in the rain.

The vintage magic seems to sing
like gliding wings of my dreams
I swim to watch the fish
leaping in the silver brook
Each crystal droplet lace their flight.

How many seasons should I wait
How long from seashore lie the waves
Memories float in my eyes
Fantasies of tomorrow
pull me to the light across the lake.
