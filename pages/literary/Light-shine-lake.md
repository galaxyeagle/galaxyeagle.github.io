title: Light that shines across the lake

A streak of light is shining soft  <br>
Wandering in the autumn hills  <br>
I hear the deep rhythm   <br>
through the coloured clouds around. <br>
They disappear in the rain.  <br>

The vintage magic seems to sing  <br>
like gliding wings of my dreams  <br>
I swim to watch the fish  <br>
leaping in the silver brook  <br>
Each crystal droplet lace their flight.<br>  

How many seasons should I wait  <br>
How long from seashore lie the waves<br>
Memories float in my eyes  <br>
Fantasies of tomorrow  <br>
pull me to the light across the lake.<br>
