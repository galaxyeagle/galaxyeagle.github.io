Empty, grey and barren streets  
Fear in people's eyes  
Coffins fill the churchesw deep  
No one to say goodbye.  

What a hollow, hollow world  
How fragile is human life  
How ill-equipped is our mighty race   
to douse this crippling fire.  

I watch the painful news at five  
Brothers and sisters battling for their lives  
Doctors and their teams fighting through the show   
No ordnance factory makes arms to fight this foe.  

O devil donned in the garb of flu  
You vicious villain - SARS-Cov 2.

But one day these dark clouds will melt away  
The bright sunshine will flood the mountains;  
Fresh air will blow our cares away,  
Old friends will meet with unworn smiles,  
busy streets their charms redeem,  
broken dreams again find steam.  
But to reach that hallowed shore,  
humankind must fight, fight hard, and win this war !
