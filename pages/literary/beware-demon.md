title:  Beware the demon

It can snatch your soul and pale your eyes;  
Deprive you of life and joy and hope;  
Trap you in the dip of living death.  
A tension of silence, pain and broken dreams;  
A day diminished by the demon of lost time;  
A loser invited at his own mind’s pulpit;  
A coward tutoring the forward guard;  
A cloudy mind behind the wheels,  
on an unruly freeway.  
It doesn’t suit.  
It’s shameful and gory:  
An egregious mockery of the creator.  
When the loudest babbles  
drown out whispers of reason;  
When deceit of an inglorious surrender  
crushes the logical fight-till-death;  
When bubbles of imported inceptions   
destroy the cockpit vision:  
I don’t know what becomes,  
but nothing worthwhile.
