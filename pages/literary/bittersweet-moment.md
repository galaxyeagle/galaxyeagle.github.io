Another moment of excitement,
a moment of surprise;
a moment that hitherto
could scarce open its eyes.

A heart blushing like fever,
a mind brimming like sea;
a song that slowly whispers
what birds could sing to me.

Another place, another time
reminds me of you tonight:
the happiness, the jocund jokes
that burst us as we drove.

The road was thinly dotted up,
the skies were dressed in stars;
our thoughts conjured in resonance
a tune to which Gods dance.

Our eyes were lit in lovely dreams
beneath the drizzly clouds,
descrying plans across the sea
of vivid love and hope.

I do not know where time escaped,
I do not know the world;
the pressures of the past and gone
suddenly seemed absurd.

The eve sent out a clear breeze
which rode the circling birds,
painting vivid memories
to sweeten coming years.

Nostalgic times with mom and dad
now makes me double sad.
Is it a prick enough to make
a tool to clock it back ?
