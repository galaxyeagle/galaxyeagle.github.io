title: Until the Sun shines

A life without weakness  
awaits, awaits, awaits.  
Tomorrow shall it harken beat  
upon the next soundering lark.  
The dawn will break the stars of dreams  
and shoot them through my day.  
Alright it wasn’t what should’ve been:  
unchartered men have paved my trail;  
But one with speed, the one with grit,  
overcomes the mightiest lead,  
and delivers lengthy strides.  
The haze long played its ugly game  
of satan’s dark designs.  
Those nights are gone;  
there ain’t sunsets on this rising Sun  
The war shall begin  
in right earnest,  
in cold upfront:  
be half won at the start.  
Temperament counts  
and will be replete in abundance.  
The scars have taught it all;  
they’ll wither off soon.  
A supreme drive for perfection will stay;  
every moment,  
a push from nowhere,  
inexplicable to the mortals,  
thrusting this frigid life  
with a warmest smile  
through winds of hell  
until the Sun shines.
