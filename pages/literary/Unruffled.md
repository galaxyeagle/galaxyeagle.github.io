Not all that matters fits your cast <br>
nor future mimic a tranquil past <br>
Expectations break as a rule <br>
but don't you be ruffled. <br>

Goodness is both virtue and vice <br>
Your kindness will bequeath both friends and foes <br>
Ugly plots behind your back <br>
and silence of friends <br>
will make you cry <br>
but don't you be ruffled. <br>

The short day slips, the long night spreads <br>
its claws into your tired throat. <br>
Unmet targets, ticking clocks <br>
drive you into regret and desperation <br>
and madness. <br>
Precision dies, sharpness dies, adrenalin dies, <br>
but you're alive and lost. <br>
Yet don't be ruffled bro. <br>

Another lamb, its soft heart beats: <br>
tomorrow shall be laid to sleep. <br>
When happiness is traded with pain <br>
and illiterates grow richer than rest, <br>
hellish clouds burst with cries of death. <br>
Selfish wretches live like isles <br>
scorning the drowning boats; <br>
while the patient sea mocks ! <br>
Yet in these unsound fettered times, <br>
smile at the dripping noose, <br>
uncompromised, <br>
and unruffled. <br>
