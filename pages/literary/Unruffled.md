Not all that matters fits your cast  
nor future mimic a tranquil past  
Expectations break as a rule  
but don't you be ruffled.  

Goodness is both virtue and vice  
Your kindness will bequeath both friends and foes  
Ugly plots behind your back  
and silence of friends  
will make you cry  
but don't you be ruffled.  

The short day slips, the long night spreads  
its claws into your tired throat.  
Unmet targets, ticking clocks  
drive you into regret and desperation  
and madness.  
Precision dies, sharpness dies, adrenalin dies,  
but you're alive and lost.  
Yet don't be ruffled bro.  

Another lamb, its soft heart beats:  
tomorrow shall be laid to sleep.  
When happiness is traded with pain  
and illiterates grow richer than rest,  
hellish clouds burst with cries of death.  
Selfish wretches live like isles  
scorning the drowning boats;  
while the patient sea mocks !  
Yet in these unsound fettered times,  
smile at the dripping noose,  
uncompromised,  
and unruffled.
