Linking trees unto the breeze  <br>
Another passing dusk  <br>
Calling cards like brown silhouettes <br> 
strolling down the turf.  <br>

Another round of slain bullets <br>  
Another whisk of pain  <br>
The battle isnâ€™t won or lost  <br>
where obscurity reigns.  <br>

How can Time recover me  <br>
It rolls the sooty blinds  <br>
The clamour sinks in weighty rue  <br>
beneath the dizzy winds. <br>
