Linking trees unto the breeze
Another passing dusk
Calling cards like brown silhouettes
strolling down the turf.

Another round of slain bullets
Another whisk of pain
The battle isnâ€™t won or lost
where obscurity reigns.

How can Time recover me
It rolls the sooty blinds
The clamour sinks in weighty rue
beneath the dizzy winds.
