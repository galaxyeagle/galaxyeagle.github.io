Trying without an effort  
Singing without a tone  
Living with a reason  
yet cold as martian stone  
You cannot strike a canyon  
in midst of fading rains  
A slumber worth a paisa  
rots in deepless drain  
Swift as comes november  
aft trance of festive haze  
no cries can find a reason  
in which you blindly live.
