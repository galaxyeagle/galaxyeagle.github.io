Yesternight I saw a lightning through the night shot open of my window screen to find that it was the brightest glare I watched leave the sun which I do not see at night's darkness and obscured expanse of the torrent-full-filled-ghostly-deep nimbus gliders that incredibly pervaded the discontinuous flagrance of unnatural spirits that I turn speechless to say accelerated with fire and thunder whose sound swam into my ears times onward I slept away from the disturbance over the bridges and trees of Bengal so much heretofore that the luminous light of lighted lit lightening alongwith its veinlets could have torn my wordliness alongwith the continuum of spacetime into a fourier series of tragic and magic having clouds in monsoon which mock that lightning is brighest when the sky is darkest and that the sky is darkest when eyes go deeper into vision of the undiscover'd universes and the worlds not yet invented by God or time relatively.
