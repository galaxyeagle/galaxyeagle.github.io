I stare at the clouds,   
I gaze at the seas  
My sorrows melt away   
in the soft breeze.  
The falling sun,   
it's warming smile,  
floods my eyes with misty dreams.  

Those sweet times filled my heart   
and are now gone.  
Those memories still give strength   
to these frail bones.  

So I can conquer the world  
and those faded peaks still climb  
and the splendour of my younger days  
shall shine  
till the end of time.
