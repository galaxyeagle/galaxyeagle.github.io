The blows were meant to bend my spine, <br>
the glares to blind the fervent eyes. <br>
Betrayers dressed in saviours’ suit <br>
grew wary of my free pursuit. <br>
They love corruption, love disorder; <br>
bloodline dripped off Ames and Cawdor. <br>
Scarcely can they wait to see <br>
an outbreak of my misery. <br>
‘Et tu brute’ may I shriek <br>
or strike back upon each Sadiq? <br>

I shine heart’s firmness through my face. <br>
Authenticity steams my voice. <br>
No words or wealth can trade disgrace. <br>
I don’t think twice to make the choice. <br>
Insecure myopic bugs, <br>
that ramble anxious lanes to hell, <br>
smile through dark delusional dreams <br>
and die before their waking knell. <br>
