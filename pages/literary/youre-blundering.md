title: You're blundering

You try to tie me up in chains   
Suffocating in mediocrity   
You try to hold me back in vain  
I will raise my bloody head with strength each time  
through pain…  

This ain’t the first time I am smothered in knives  
My scars have healed but they’ve taught me to strive   
Hyenas flat have come and gone with time  
Now I know how to deal with double headed snakes  

Try to smile and put a pithole in my way  
Try to cut my hands and legs  
So that I crawl to you for help  
But I won’t ,  
For that’s not how I was born and raised   
I was born like a lion and will die like one,  
never slouching my spine beneath my height.  
And though the strength in my voice and the light from my face   
Drips you in anxious sweat   
Stop checking if your chair ain’t broke   
Stop checking if your pants are dry or wet  
Stop checking if you’re stumped or still alive  
And look me deep into my eyes  
For I know how to kill my foes with a stare   
And I know how to bleed your soul with words  
Stay away from me, you won’t be able to bear;  
Don’t blame the flames if you play with fire  
Don’t laugh in battles and cry in war  
I’m strong, I like a peaceful world  
You’re Dunning weak but seek a fight.  
Are you Shishupal or Duryodhan,  
too blind to see the God before ;  
Are you so lost in vanity  
Your senses betray you?  

Wake up, you still can beg for grace   
Your troubled strikes on simple men  
reflect your haunted past  
and your shawl of insecurities,   
that my presence blows away  
and leaves you bare to winds of change.
