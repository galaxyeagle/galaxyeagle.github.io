title: Sail tight on the surface

We struggle when the winds are rough  
and settle when its calm  
Half the battle of life is lost  
in different points of view.  

Is it a mountain or a plain,  
a river or a sea?  
Is it the clouds that shroud the sun  
or the solar eclipse?  

Why venture beneath the surface  
and put peril to the smooth sail?  
And if you're hurt, keep trust in God  
and goodness of his grace.  
For bad times make both weak and strong men,  
the difference is how tight you sail  
upon the rolling surface.
