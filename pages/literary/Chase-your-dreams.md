Life is short, and yet its long enough to do all you want to do. Many make sundry decisions, often emphatically: but very few implement them vide long-term sweat and toil. Sustained passion and focus to learn and apply is a rarity. Everyone has a dream, yet very few can realize it. So chase your dreams lest you regret later on. Pursue them with the vigour of a cheetah. Sacrifice all comforts. Forget all nonsense. Resolve, commit, deliver. The world is very unkind towards losers. Be a winner. You won't be perfect; don't be foolish to presume anyone else is : but hack out the inessentials. Look forward: that's why God didn't give us eyes behind our head. Think what common men don't, do what they can't. Stay fiercely independent. Build your own strategy, have your own opinions. Don't reveal them easily. But let them form your persona, so that an aura of originality keeps shining through your eyes. Have a fiery competitive spirit, from dawn to dusk. Fuel the fire within: never let it droop. Become an inspiration to the world. Set the trend and lead the change.
