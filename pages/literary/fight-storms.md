You can sometimes rub your eyes
until you realise
this world's a slideshow of surprise.

Chanting the rugged prayers,
carrying what few can bear
through weeks and months and years.

A reactor simmering bright
pulsates a charge of dreams
as you your book rewrite.

You rise like Lazarus from dens of death:
like sunny air drives fusts of fiend,
like squalls of laughter wipe a tear,
rays of hope through clouds of fear

The forest stag detracking roads
is vanished out of sight
like Icarusâ€™ fearless flight.

Time doth tick, the sun's on lease,
burn until your will can breathe.
Rein, run, jump lest its late,
o'er triple bars of iron fate.
