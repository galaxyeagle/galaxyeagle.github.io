Chirp little thrush  
as morning dewdrops crush  
upon the springing grass,  
beneath the lightening sky,  
across the rolling hills,  
beyond the mortal craze.  

Search within your soul  
the kindness someone stole  
away from linear towns  
into your song profound :   
inspiring to dream   
and live it with a smile.  

A smile to cheer the sad; 
warm voice to melt the trapped  
prisons of old thought;  
to usher fresh emotions  
of adventure and life :  
a season unsurmised.  

Birds whistle as I scale  
the meandering trail.  
A euphonic choir  
reflects out of me  
like an arch rainbow waving  
greetings of Diwali.
