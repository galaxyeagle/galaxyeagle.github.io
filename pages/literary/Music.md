Music speaks more than words  
And soothes the heart be eased  
And calms with tune the setting sky  
And make soul’s spirit pleased  

The heart rejoices at the notes  
And lulls the tired brain  
Beneath the shade of cloudy winds  
Adds rhythm to the rain.  

Till heart discovers with a poise   
The wideness of all space  
And while breeze rustles the drowsy leaves  
Adds fuel to the race.  

Our thoughts align to music’s thought  
And hues of life it lives  
Our thoughts align to flow of songs  
And message that it gives.  

Music makes a dead man live  
Within a pensive mind  
It gives an aim to a weary death  
And eyes to a blind.
