Soldiers are humans, with flesh, blood and emotions.
They feel
the breath and grief of their kin.
War and the chaos of this selfish world turns brothers and friends
against each other; it makes us suspicious
of our own kind; it erodes trust and peace and hope and solace.
The soldiers on either side lose it all and gain
nothing but honor.
But what for?
The real victory lies in those little moments of friendship among enemies,
when they discover the divine bondage tying them, even in the midst of this war.
Peace is precious. It is the building block of progress, happiness and healthy relationships.
Festivals melt the hardest hearts and draw them to truce.
But ain't this vanishing away ?
Greed has blinded the ones with power.
Foot soldiers become pawns to majestic designs
that's too rough to be compassionate.
But God is watching,
and his grace will redeem the lost flowers from the lava of hatred.
