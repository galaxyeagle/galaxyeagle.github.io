He fights at fronts, he roughs through storms. <br>
Another blade, another slash <br>
wound him. <br>
Impoverished cycles of life <br>
lie strewn before his eyes. <br>
The elixir drips from his lips <br>
and sinks in throats of sand. <br>
The streets are empty, the roads wish wear; <br>
while curfew on samaritans stifles fresh air. <br>
He begs not rogues for sinful grace: <br>
for butchers alive on hired hell <br>
can't lend any shadow of life ! <br>
He battles odds full drenched in pain <br>
and clad in robes of grit. <br>
Today may be his nemesis.. <br>
tomorrow will be his steed ! <br>
