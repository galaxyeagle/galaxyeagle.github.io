I found new friends and they pulled me out of my home.  
Then we rocked the town and rolled the streets all along.  
But I forgot my true friends were waiting for me in my home.  
So we kept, kept rovin' about in places all unknown.

Those times were nice, unbothered we soared so high;  
but one day I was hurt, and the sun seemed so low, right behind.

Why can't people bear the goodness of their friends?  
Why can't brothers bear the fortune of their kin?  
Why can't the insecure bear the blast of the guns?  
Why can't Yama bear the life of the good ones?  

Does God give justice well within this life?  
If yes, why do our righteous soldiers die,  
while the ignoble cowards survive?  

Let me know.  
Let me know.  

For when I asked for help from my ole good friends,  
never thought they'd betray me.  
Yea the more I helped this thankless world,  
the more they betrayed me.  

And all the autumn friends turned their backs on me,  
I was left in the dark wilderness that eve;  
and I cried in shock but no one was there to wipe my dripping tears.  
Yet I dusted up and stood again to return to my home,  
all alone,  
all alone,  
back to my home,  
I need no help,  
I'll find my way,  
back to my home,  
sweet sweet home,  
I'll find my way,    
all alone,    
all alone.
