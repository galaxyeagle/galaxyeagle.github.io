title: Rain at night

O rain<br>
drop from the distant heights<br>
unending till you die<br>
oft slowing but unpaused<br>
as if crying without a cause<br>
the drenched leaves do not stop<br>
your shower from atop<br>
O let me know your heart<br>
what keeps you up at night<br>
Teach me how to start<br>
a relentless fight<br>
I may win or I may fall<br>
I may weep through the turns of war<br>
Poor blood may streak my eyes<br>
My heart may thrum like flies<br>
But so long as you still pour<br>
on the vanquished plains of yore<br>
I will all harsh pains endure<br>
remembering your smile.<br>
- Raman Butta
