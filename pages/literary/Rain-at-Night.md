title: Rain at night

O rain
drop from the distant heights
unending till you die
oft slowing but unpaused
as if crying without a cause
the drenched leaves do not stop
your shower from atop
O let me know your heart
what keeps you up at night
Teach me how to start
a relentless fight
I may win or I may fall
I may weep through the turns of war
Poor blood may streak my eyes
My heart may thrum like flies
But so long as you still pour
on the vanquished plains of yore
I will all harsh pains endure
remembering your smile.
- Raman Butta
