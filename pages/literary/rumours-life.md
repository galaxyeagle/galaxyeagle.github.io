title: Rumours about life

I heard  
some rumours that life is unpredictable  
rubs salt on your worst fears  
like a boggart.  
Is untrustworthy  
and illusive  
and merciless.  

But life is the vehicle of your being.  
It's your soulmate through smiles and sobs.  
Your elite company in mediocre surroundings.  
It is you.  
How can you not love yourself ?  
Follow great minds, great lives, great dreams  
and dress yourself in those great robes every moment.  
Emulate the image, for Ashoka had said:  
No one is what he is, but what he is going to be.  
And you will enjoy its camaraderie  
like Arjun enjoyed Krishna's.  

In another view, it's like AI:  
its efficiency and behaviour depends on how you prompt it.  
It's a good servant and a bad master.   
Give it an unflinching focus and it will deliver you to stardom.  
De-focus and you shatter down the gorge of hell  
and curse life till you disintegrate to death.
