This world is a chaotic system on a two dimensional plane of thought. However there is recluse and calm on the z-axis. But how many can
actually lift their head and scroll in the third dimension? Not many. Few can smile through adversity and mock their wounds. This world is
like a cyclone with a vociferous skin but a peaceful eye. But how many can resist the centrifugal force and stay unblown? Those who do are
rare. They have both admirers and enviers. They sketch and etch the indelible history and branch from the constrained orthodoxy to their
own empire of renaissance. Grisly wounds may chequer them through the vicissitudes of the war of life, but they emerge as true heroes at
the end, sometimes even as they lose !
