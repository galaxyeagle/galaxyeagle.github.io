Everytime I smile, you smile with me.
Everytime you close your tender eyes,
I dream the world with you.
Everytime I gaze the skies above,
the stars talk of us.
Everytime we drive together,
the roads gently light up.

These are the days of perseverance,
looking back we shall remember.
While the summer looks so distant,
we’ll pass this cold December.

Though we run through gusts of tribulations,
We keep walking hand in hand.
Soon we’ll pick the highway to freedom.
Soon we’ll arrive at the promised land.

And even if we never reach conclusions,
we’ll perish on the tide,
knowing that we kept our twin flames breathing
up until we sunk and died.
