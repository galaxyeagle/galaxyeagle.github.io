Look
I will make you proud
There’s nothing else I live for
there’s nothing else i want

Words
May fall short of my thoughts
So I express in actions
Then wait for your reactions

I stretch
Over limits of hope
There’s nothing as dope
Than writing your own destiny
Everyday

Finding my way
I’m here
when nothing is clear
Sore
Till the end of my bones
In these rough and rugged battles
I carry myself all along

But mother
Your prayers
Will be answered soon

And father
Your son will shine one day
He’ll melt your stress away
Away
