You can write your thoughts
on the journal of my heart
You can paint your dreams
this world's a piece of art.

You can scorn the shadow
when it dresses in disguise
You can sing the sweet song
when you find a tune in life.

You can hold my hand
when you cannot figure out
I'll pull out and save you
from the bogs of gloom and doubt.

My son you'll see the
code of joy unlock
You are special dear,
a cabalistic hawk !
