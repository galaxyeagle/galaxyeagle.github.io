Lost in the woods <br>
The beating fog<br>
reminds me of the vanished days<br>
Broken and stitched, yet sweeter.<br>
Of course I see the waves that lie <br>
across the blinking coast<br>
respiring of hope unparalleled :<br>
power to serve and to stand upon,<br>
experience to deal with traditional blocks,<br>
to rise above the nonchalant dailies,<br>
and an ability to do what the mind thinks,<br>
A knowledge of the shrouded self<br>
and re-birth of a sunken courage.<br>
And yet the laughter of that child undoes the pomp of the hour.<br>
