# My CSS Learning Journey

You can head to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to play with the basics of CSS. After you know what its about, you can follow my footsteps as follows. The source I referred was primarily [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). Others will be hyperlinked along the way.

## 1. Flexbox

This is the first important CSS module I learnt. It helps in the alignment and spacing between items on a container arranged in horizontal and vertical axes. Refer to the [MDN Flexbox Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout#guides). It works with the `display:flex` property within a `<div>` with the class of `container`. The main concepts you should strongly grasp are:  
* The two axes of flexbox
* The flex container
* Key properties like `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `align-items`, `justify-content` and `flex`(combining flex-start, flex-shrink & flex-basis). For these properties, I found the [Codevolution Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwg6rjbiMadCILrjh7QkvzoQ) very helpful.

## 2. Grid layout

This is the most popular alternative to the flexbox layout. It works with the `display:grid` property within the container. The [SlayingTheDragon Tutorial on Grids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE) explains it best.
