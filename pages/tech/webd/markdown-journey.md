I am a heavy user of Markdown. I started using it when I started working on my Github Pages website back in 2020. I used on Notepad++ back then and used Git Bash to push it to the Github. I shifted to Sublime Text a couple of years later and started using its in-built terminal instead of Git Bash. Sublime used a nice syntax highlighting and coloring for the code enhancing readibility. 

In 2024, I started writing Markdown in VS Code, mainly to write some tutorials for Web Development. The indexing based on # and readability is awesome. VS Code offers a live preview of your Markdown as you type. And the interface is has more tools than Sublime. The Prettier extension creates automatic indentations. The in-built intellisense allowed me to quickly paste hyperlinks, etc. I struggled for sometime in using intellisense for the HTML code inserted within .md files. VS Code uses intellisense auto-suggestions only for the default file language. I tried several popular Markdown enhancement extensions but found that VS Code already has incorporated them by default, so it was redundant. Then I settled by changing the file language to HTML instead of Markdown at the bottom-left of the screen whenever I wanted to write an HTML snippet (eg. img tag) and intellisense worked.

I also use [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) when I quickly want to type online without a software.

So I started Markdown for blogging, but started writing technical tutorials on it. When I need to run some Python or JS standalone code as well, I use Jupyter notebook where I can insert Markdown cells at will. For larger sourcecode, I simply use an md file and refer to my Codepen.
