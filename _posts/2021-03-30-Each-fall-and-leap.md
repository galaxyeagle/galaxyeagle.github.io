title: Each fall and leap
---

O look at you  
a desperate soul  
another cog   
in a blinding hole.

The breeze and nimb  
rafted the trees  
Old friends and happy  
waved trophies.

Upon each purple  
prose you wrote  
each ounce of life  
gulped down your throat.  

Each stretch of space  
each breadth of time  
so numbly wept  
so oddly kept.

Lingering on  
till you retire  
feeding logs  
in dark hellfire.

Look no further  
plumb no deep  
Your eyes decide  
each fall and leap.
