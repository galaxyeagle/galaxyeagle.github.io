title : Making graph diagrams in Python
---
Graphviz is a great open-source software to create graphs. In graph theory of mathematics, a graph is a network of nodes connected by lines. Some well known graphs are flowcharts, trees,network diagrams, state-transition diagrams, etc.  
Graphviz is written & operated in the Dot language. This software can be downloaded from https://www.graphviz.org/download/.  
But if you don't want to work in the Dot language, you can instead work with a python wrapper of Graphviz called 'python-graphviz' in Python language without even installing the Graphviz software. This post is all about that folks ! So read ahead !
