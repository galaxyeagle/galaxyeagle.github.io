Today, the 8th of May, 2020 marks five years of the inception of my first big trip outside my country India - an internship tour to 
TÃ¼bingen, Germany. I was inexperienced but full of the youthful stir and adeptness to meet and greet the unknown. And so I set foot into 
uncharted territory. What I gained by the end of the internship wasn't a windfall, but was withal invaluable. For as Da Vinci said, if once
you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your head turned skyward. What I tasted was the power of technology. I learnt 
how labs truly work, how research teams function, and how strong computers and visionary people can change the world. I believe that anyone 
who gets such an opportunity should live up to it - should be resolved to sacrifice many comforts in order to "overachieve", as Kobe Bryant 
used to say. My internship work is summarised <a href="https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/58710/272198"> here </a>. I'll also write a separate post to share my experience of that internship, and link it here.
