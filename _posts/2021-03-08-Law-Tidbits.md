## Indian Evidence Act ##

Section 3 : Definitions

Court, Facts, Facts in issue, Relevancy of one fact to another, Evidence,
Primary evidence sec 62(original copies), Secondary evidence sec 63(photocopies & oral evidence)

Whenever it cannot be certainly said in any matter on the basis of evidence produced that a fact is neither proved nor disproved, it will be called 'not proved'.

Section 4 - "May presume." "Shall Presume." "Conclusive proof."

"May presume."-Whenever it is provided by this Act that the Court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it: "Shall presume."-Whenever it is directed by this Act that the Court shall presume a fact, it shall regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved: "Conclusive proof."-When one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the Court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it.

Direct evidence is one which directly proves fact in issue. Indirect => one can only infer from it 

Testimony : a specific type of evidence (given by a witness)

Sec 32(1) - Dying declaration

Confession (self-admission) is a subset of Admission(-> Secs 17-31 IE Act). Usually Admission is in civil cases, but confession is in criminal cases. Also if A says the circumstances in which he murdered B, he's admitting. But if he DIRECTLY says that he killed B, he confesses. Confession can lead to punishment. But Admiision isn't a conclusive proof, however its an estoppel (as per Sec 31 IE Act). Confession can be judicial (U/S 164 CrPC)(also ref Sec 161 IPC for examn. of witness by police) or extrajudicial.
