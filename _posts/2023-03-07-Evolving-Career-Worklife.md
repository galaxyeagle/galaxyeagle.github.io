title: Evolving career and worklife
---



In earlier days people used to dedicate themselves entirely to their job life. Outside their jobs, life was limited to eating and sleeping. They were completely loyal and switching jobs over the course of their career was a rarity. The world has become so different today. <br>

The rapid pace of development has created an understandable unrest and impatience among the youth. The young man today very commonly finds himself more qualified than what his present job demands. Opportunities are much more but the competition is also far more. The employers are also aware of the existence of this mentality. They therefore want to extract as much work as possible from their employees without giving them the luxury of creative thinking or the opportunity of self growth. In other words, human resource has also become commodified. This has no doubt sparked enormous rate of entrepreneurial and corporate growth, but the levels of self disbelief, fickle mindedness and unrest and anxiety among the youth is also at unprecedented levels. Mark my words : In this rat race, many ideal, but intelligent, hard-working and smart individuals, go unnoticed and lose the opportunities which the extrovert youngsters grab. The world doesnâ€™t even have the time to empathize with them, let alone help them. Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear: Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
