title: What's eating up your PC data?
---

Often certain processes running in the background of your PC can suck away a lot of internet data very quickly. Most of these are updates to various softwares, usually Windows softwares. However if you're running on a limited data plan, you'd prefer to delay the updates to a later time. If your data usage suddenly increases, do these 2 steps:  
  
1) First go to 'Check for Updates' settings in your PC. If updates are running, pause them.  
2) If it doesn't slow the data leak, go to Task Manager -> Performance -> Open Resource Monitor (at the bottom) -> then go to Network tab & check the processes consuming data. Right click on the culprit & click 'Suspend' or 'End'.  
  
That's gonna solve your problem. If you know other strategies to check real-time network usage, do comment.
