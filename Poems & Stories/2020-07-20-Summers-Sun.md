title: Summer's Sun
---
O Summer as sweet as nectar drops <br>
you live and die each passing day<br>
a light draught sweeps thee yonder west<br>
a dark drizzle recesses fill<br>
you smile but through the muffling clouds<br>
that lie in eyes and not in skies<br>
O What a pity if under your light<br>
most grisly injustices abide<br>
How far is truth from what you see<br>
How far goodness from verity<br>
Or is this life a better bet<br>
against a mortal pain?<br>
O chequered swarms skidding through<br>
the fettered rails of blue<br>
like frisking shoals on silent seas<br>
like vernal gardens drenched in bees<br>
The fading sun stays yonder large<br>
for sulken shores its sails embarge<br>
to leave us sob in timeless ache<br>
through bleak and stony nights.<br>
